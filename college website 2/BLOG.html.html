               <h2>Our certificate & Online Programs For 2021</h2>
               <p>
                Today's job experts stress the importance of post-high-school vocational training. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) notes that those with some college but no degree (including diploma and certificate recipients) face a 3.3% unemployment rate, and earn a median weekly salary of $833. By comparison, <br> who complete their education with a high school diploma face a 3.7% unemployment rate, and earn a median weekly salary of $746 per week.
                Diploma and certificate programs can also serve as a useful stepping stone for students who wish to eventually earn a higher degree, such as an associate or a bachelor's.<br> In some cases, credits earned toward a certificate or diploma will be transferrable into more advanced academic programs.
                Please note that this certificate and diploma guide exclusively discusses undergraduate learning options. Graduate diplomas and certificates are not included in this guide.

                certificate: Certificate programs are available in specialized technical fields; they usually include little to no formal coursework, and instead focus on practicum (or hands-on) training.<br> Professions that may earn certification include plumbers, automotive mechanics, electricians, IT managers, paralegals, and healthcare administrators. <br>Certifications are also widely available in different areas of business management and administration. In most cases, the only prerequisite for a certificate will be a high school diploma or GED. Certificates generally span 20 to 30 credits in length, and most can be earned within one academic year or less.
               </p>

                Diploma: Like certificates, diplomas are also available in specialized vocational or technical fields. However, they usually include a combination of formal coursework and practicum training. <br>As a result, diploma programs are longer and more in-depth than certificates; most span 40 to 60 credits in length, and can usually be completed within one to two years.<br>Diplomas are offered in fields like IT management, computer programming, graphic and web design, medical and dental office administration, paralegal studies, and property management.
